Puzzle Game where you Drag and Grapple to Cubes to position them to benefit you to finish the puzzles. You have 2 diffrent coloured beams which affect the objects differently depending on the colour. The same colour will allow you to drag the cubes over a spline while the opposite will let you to grapple towards the cube to get to higher ground.

The whole game was made solo as part of my FMP which is the final project which I done for my university. I have decided on making a puzzle game which are quite hard to make and its difficult making them fun and enjoyable.
