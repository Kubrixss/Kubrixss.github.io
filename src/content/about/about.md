I am a Game Designer from Southampton Solent University. I always had a passion for Video Games and wanted to make some of my own. One of my goals to to produce a character with interesting abilities and fun gameplay. I have always been interesting in making unique characters but I also like to to Level Design and just Design in general designing and making different aspects of the game as my head is always full of unique and interesting ideas.

I have started making games since 2019 in College where I made simple games in which mostly focused on Art and looking visualy pleasing.  Ever since then I have been interested in making games and I always look for new ideas and learn new things to help me develop the ideas I have.
