In this Blog I will be going over some changes which I have done to my game from the Beta Testing which I did a Week prior. These changes are made to make the game better and more enjoyable for the player.

With all the feedback I have received I have used quite a lot of it to improve the game I have been making. Almost all feedback has been saying how Area 3 is quite confusing and hard to tell what does what. So I have done major changes to Area 3 with the help of the feedback I got. First thing I have done is colour coded each of the areas to red, pink and blue to separate them and show the player that these are separate islands where the player has to solve the puzzles there to finish the game. Few pieces of feedback suggested colour code the areas to make it more obvious where the puzzles connect and go together.

With adding the colours to the islands I had to make new textures for everything like grass, ground and the leafs for the trees which took me quite a while to do. I have also added extra details to the islands while I was at it by adding some flowers and falling leaves to the trees to make it more visually pleasing and make the areas stand out more.















































I have also added some clarity to quite a lot of the puzzles in Area 3 as well by having a floating crystal next to the pressure plates which changes colour when activated. Another crystal is placed at the opposite location which that pressure plate connects to so that the player has a line of sight to what the pressure plate does or at least which area it affects. I have also made sure that the player can see both the crystals from their positions so it's obvious which crystals connect. This means if the player is at one crystal if they look around they will be able to see the 2nd crystal from that position. I made the ones that connect to platforms orange while the ones that connect to a door red.

I have also made sure that the crystals next to pressure plates are visible to the player as soon as they walk into the island so that the player has an idea and goal to where they have to get to and do. This is also part of the feedback as some players wanted to see a goal from the start so that they knew what they were working towards.
One of the 3 puzzles in Area 3 had major issues which the players struggled with. The current Red Island, which is a Medium puzzle player, struggled with finding what they had to do and they made a lot of circles around the island. I have moved the players to be more visible. For that I had to make another small island. This island made it more obvious where the player wanted to get to and it was visible from both the high points which were on the islands so that the player always knew their goal. This made it more obvious what the player had to do and made the goal for the player visible so that the player knew where they wanted to go.





























When it came to the Pink Island which is a Large Puzzle I didn't do many changes to it. I have added the floating crystals to it so that the player knew that they needed to do 3 pressure plates to open the door and each of the crystals pointed to the direction where they could find the said pressure plate. I have also moved the door which leads the player to the inside of the mountain to the front of the island. I have done that as it will be the first thing the player sees when going to the island so that they will know what their goal is and what they are trying to open.






















While most of the changes are to Area 3 I did small changes to Area 1 and 2 to make them more enjoyable as some people didn't like certain parts or wanted a few things easier. In Last Room in Area 1 I have added an easy way to get back up to the first platform as some people struggled with grappling and that makes sense as it's the first area where the player is learning. In the 2nd Area I have adjusted a parkour Section which Happened in B section as it was not needed and some players found that quite annoying.










































For the last parts of feedback I have done small adjustments to the gameplay features I had. First thing I done is I have lowered the cooldown of the grapple from 3 seconds to 1.5 as sometimes when the player let go early by accident or something else would happen it was quite annoying waiting 3 seconds to grapple again so I halved the cooldown which made it way more fun to use and improved the experience as well.

Then I have adjusted some settings in the player to give the player more Air Control and give more Drag as some people with lower FPS seemed to be launched a lot with the grapple and that will give them more control where they land and should reduce the big launch some players had.

I have also made it faster to walk with the Grabbable box as everybody has said that it was way too slow when grabbing it and getting it to the place where the player wanted it. I have only made it a little bit faster as when it's too fast there are some issues that pop up.

All of the changes are shipped to [Itch](https://kubrixss.itch.io/magneticpull) where the players can experience the new changes and play the improved game.
