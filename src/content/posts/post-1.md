Through the past 12 weeks I have been working on a Puzzle game. These types of games are pretty difficult to make as to make fun and engaging puzzles are pretty difficult to design and then make. Throughout the whole process there were many ups and downs which I went through but the end result is even better than I have imagined.

Through the development I have struggled a lot with BluePrinting as it's something I am not good at and this was very challenging as I wanted to make a puzzle game meaning I had to design and make very specific features which was pretty hard to find any tutorials or anything on how to make. Especially on how to make a player drag a cube smoothly over a spline. There were many issues with that and there are still some issues which I haven't been able to fix but overall the mechanic works as intended and to the best of my abilities of what I could find and do in the time I had.

When it came to the schedule I have made I went very ahead of it by multiple days which allowed me to make and do things which I haven't included in it. By adding convenient features and playing around and learning how to make cool and interesting materials and VFXs for my game which I did a lot early on and only used it on the last few weeks with some adjustments.

In the last 2 weeks I had Beta testing where 26 People have tested my game and gave feedback about it. I have also timed how long it takes people to finish it with an average of 32 minutes to finish the game. I did a table calculating the average times between testers who play puzzle games and testers who dont which There was a 3 minute difference which isn't that big meaning everybody can play and enjoy the game.

There were a lot of interesting pieces of feedback which I have received from the survey I have sent out.to the testers. A lot of people have found Area 3 extremely confusing and hard to navigate. The issue a lot of the testers pointed out is that they didnt know which puzzle they were doing and didn't know what connected it to what with the pressure plates.

Few of the testers in feedback have suggested to colour code the areas which was a quite smart idea as it will give people an idea which area they are in and where the puzzles connect to at least in what area they do something in. I had 4 Sections in Area 3 in which I made them Purple, Red, Blue and lastly Green for the middle area where it connects the other 3.

To try to solve the issue of people not knowing what the pressure plates connect to I have added floating crystals next to the pressure plates which change colour when activated to show that they are activated and on. I tried my hardest to make it so that a 2nd crystal is visible from the same spot to show where it is connecting and what/where it may affect something that the player has activated. The 2 crystals connecting should most of the time have line of sight to each other for visual clarity which is very important.

Another thing which I did to the crystals to make it even more obvious to what they connect to is I made them all different colours depending on what they connect to. As there were multiple crystals in One of the Areas which at a certain point wasn't obvious which one connected to what so I colour coded them to make it more obvious.

Overall I am quite happy with the feedback I have gotten and the reception to the game being quite positive with a lot of the testers callining fun and enjoyable which was my biggest concern. A lot of the testers also have called the game too easy and wanted more challenging content which is quite understandable and this specific feedback makes me quite happy as it means the testers wanted play more of the game and have something more challenging meaning if I did add more levels which were harder they would be happy to play more and challenge themselves.

As I am getting close to the end of my development of the game I am making final little adjustments to the game to make it run and feel better. I have optimed the game a lot since the Beta Testing, making it way less laggy and added new and improved textures to certain objects like the doors. Made several adjustments to the puzzle mechanics to make them smoother by adjusting the range and the cooldowns of certain things which made the puzzles a bit clunky before. ![image info](https://kubrixss.github.io/posts/Door.png)


All of the changes are shipped to [Itch](https://kubrixss.itch.io/magneticpull) where the players can experience the new changes and play the improved game.
